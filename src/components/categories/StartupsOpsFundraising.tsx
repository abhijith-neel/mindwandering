        <h3>8/7 Distribution</h3>
        <p>There is a massive distribution problem in the way that tech works. When living in proximity to the Bay Area, it isn't something that you particularly think of, but tech propogation (and the lack thereof) is actually a huge opportunity.
          I've been recently have a slew of conversations with one of my friends that lives in Chicago on how AI really hasn't found its way outside of SF. He recently started a new business where he is building relatively simple AI agents for small businesses, because the tech just hasn't reached them yet.
          To many of these people, AI is this far away technology that is probably going to either take their job or absolutely overhaul their business in the next few years. They have a ton of rote tools that they need to get accomplished like HR, scheduling, customer service, etc. but dont know that the tools to automate these already exist.
          This is an insane opportunity to build something that is truly long lasting and can revolutionize job functions and industries.
