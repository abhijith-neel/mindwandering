      <h3>7/28 What happens at AGI</h3>
      <p>It's time to disco with AGI. At this point, all of the major AI labs have effectively gotten an absolute lock on building LLMs and models in general. As long as Meta keeps pushing to open source every model they make, I'm sure models are only going to get cheaper over every iteration. Lets say in like 5-10 years, we reach a point of AGI, and in about 15 years, the AGI models are effectively 0 cost. 
        Waht does the world look like then? Models can not only solve any problem posed to them, they are able to recursively find new problems with what they are doing and solve those. In essence, they are able to iteratively solve every white collar job out there.</p>
        <p>This effectively starts begging the question of what is the real utility of AGI? Lets</p>

          <h3>7/30 Applicaiton Layer AI</h3>
          <p> It is currently the middle of 2025. Ubiquitous AI use is about 2.5 years old (since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022). There are 5 major LLM Model builders that are putting out the best models: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Meta and Xai. AI agents are starting to take over many facets of our daily lives and job functions are being eliminated by these technologies. 
            Current models are not exactly at a point where they will overtake society, but they are showing promise of being able to do many integral white collar tasks even better than humans. Even with the current models, we have the technology to complete a lot of basic job functions much better and faster than people have been able to ever before.
